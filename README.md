Agriculture activity is essential for human, one of the most consumed vegetables are chili. The application of computer vision can help to increase the productivity of crop cultivation such as object classification and segmentation using deep learning. In this project, 100 images of chili farm dataset have been trained to classify objects in chili farm environment for robot navigation and obstacle avoidance.
